Ths is a project that seeks to compile codes and solve tasks based on 0x14 bit manuplation
the following are the task

* `0. 0`
  * [0-binary_to_uint.c](./0-binary_to_uint.c): C function that converts a binary number
  to an `unsigned int`.
  * The parameter `b` is a pointer to a string of `0` and `1` characters.
  * If `b` is `NULL` or there are one or more characters in `b` that are
  not `0` or `1` - returns `0`.
  * Otherwise - returns the converted number.

* `1. 1`
  * [1-print_binary.c](./1-print_binary.c): C function that prints the binary representation
  of a number.

* `2. 10`
  * [2-get_bit.c](./2-get_bit.c): C function that returns the value of a bit at a
  given index.
  * Indices start at `0`.
  * If an error occurs - returns `-1`.
  * Otherwise - returns the value of the bit at the given index.
